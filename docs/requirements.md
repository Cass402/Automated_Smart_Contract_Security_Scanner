# Project Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the requirements for the Automated Smart Contract Security Scanner, a tool designed to analyze Solidity smart contracts for common vulnerabilities (e.g., re-entrancy, integer overflow, front-running). It provides a detailed description of the project’s scope, functionality, performance metrics, and design constraints. The goal is to create a minimum viable product (MVP).

### 1.2 Scope

The project aims to build a comprehensive, automated scanner that:

- Parses and analyzes Solidity source code.
- Identifies known vulnerabilities using static analysis techniques.
- Presents the analysis results via a user-friendly UI.
- Integrates with blockchain networks to verify on-chain deployed bytecode.

The MVP will focus on core functionalities and be extendable for future enhancements.

### 1.3 Audience

- **Developers & Security Auditors:** Interested in the tool’s technical capabilities.
- **Potential Employers:** Evaluating your technical prowess and project management skills.
- **Grant Agencies & DAOs:** Assessing the tool for future investment and further development.

## 2. Project Objectives

- **Automated Analysis:** Build an engine that automatically scans Solidity code for vulnerabilities.
- **User-Friendly Reporting:** Develop a clear, intuitive dashboard that summarizes findings.
- **Blockchain Verification:** Provide a module to retrieve and analyze on-chain bytecode.
- **Modular & Scalable Design:** Ensure the system can be extended with additional vulnerability checks or blockchain features.
- **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for both users and developers.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Input Module

- **Code Upload:** Users should be able to input Solidity source code via file upload or a code editor.
- **Contract Selection:** Support scanning of single or multiple smart contracts.

### 3.2 Analysis Engine

- **Parsing:** Use the Solidity compiler (solc) to generate an AST for the code.
- **Vulnerability Detection:**
  - Identify known vulnerabilities such as re-entrancy, integer overflow/underflow, front-running, and more.
  - Use pattern matching against a database of vulnerability signatures.
- **Reporting:**
  - Generate a detailed report for each detected vulnerability.
  - Include severity levels, affected code segments, and recommendations for mitigation.

### 3.3 UI Dashboard

- **Visualization:** Present vulnerability findings in an easy-to-understand format (charts, tables, and code snippets).
- **Interactivity:** Allow users to drill down into specific vulnerabilities for more detailed information.
- **Alerts/Notifications:** Provide real-time feedback or alerts when potential issues are detected.

### 3.4 Blockchain Integration

- **On-Chain Verification:**
  - Fetch deployed bytecode using blockchain APIs (Web3.py).
  - Compare on-chain bytecode with the analyzed Solidity source to ensure integrity.
- **Manual Triggers:** Enable users to manually initiate verification for specific contracts.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance

- **Speed:** The scanner should analyze contracts within a reasonable timeframe, ideally a few seconds to a minute depending on code complexity.
- **Scalability:** The system must handle multiple simultaneous requests, particularly in a production environment.

### 4.2 Usability

- **User Interface:** The dashboard should be intuitive and accessible, requiring minimal training for end users.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear instructions and a user guide for operating the tool.

### 4.3 Reliability & Availability

- **Error Handling:** Robust error detection and logging for issues during parsing, scanning, or blockchain interactions.
- **Uptime:** Aim for high availability, especially if integrating with live blockchain data.

### 4.4 Security

- **Data Security:** Secure user-submitted code and analysis results.
- **Access Control:** Implement appropriate authentication and authorization measures, especially for blockchain integrations.

## 5. Use Cases & User Stories

### 5.1 Use Case: Developer Scanning a Smart Contract

- **User Story:**
  As a developer, I want to upload my Solidity code to the scanner so that I can detect potential vulnerabilities before deploying my contract on-chain.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The developer can upload a file or paste code into the editor.
  - The scanner returns a report detailing detected vulnerabilities with suggestions for remediation.

### 5.2 Use Case: Security Auditor Verifying On-Chain Code

- **User Story:**
  As a security auditor, I want to fetch the deployed bytecode of a smart contract and compare it against the source code to ensure no tampering has occurred.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The auditor inputs a contract address.
  - The system retrieves and analyzes the bytecode, then presents a comparison report.

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 6.1 Assumptions

- Users have a basic understanding of smart contract development and common vulnerabilities.
- The tool will primarily support Ethereum-based Solidity contracts for the initial MVP.

### 6.2 Dependencies

- **External Libraries:**
  - Solidity compiler (solc) for AST generation.
  - Web3 libraries for blockchain interactions.
- **Third-Party Tools:**
  - Potential integration with existing tools (e.g., Slither, Mythril) for enhanced vulnerability detection.
- **Development Environment:**
  - Cloud or local infrastructure for hosting the web interface and analysis engine.

## 7. Constraints

- **Scope Limitations:** Initial version will support a limited set of vulnerability checks and focus on Ethereum. Future iterations can extend support.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

- **Core Functionalities:**
  - Successfully upload and scan Solidity code.
  - Correctly detect and report at least the primary vulnerabilities (re-entrancy, integer overflow/underflow, front-running).
  - Display results in a user-friendly dashboard.
  - Perform on-chain verification of deployed bytecode.
- **User Experience:**
  - The tool should be intuitive and accessible, with clear documentation provided.
- **Performance:**
  - Analysis and report generation should occur within acceptable time limits for an MVP.
- **Security:**
  - The application should securely handle code input and blockchain data, with error handling in place.

## 9. Future Considerations

- **Enhanced Vulnerability Coverage:** Extend analysis to cover additional, more complex vulnerabilities.
- **Integration with CI/CD:** Automate scanning as part of a continuous integration pipeline.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support:** Expand compatibility beyond Ethereum to other smart contract platforms.
- **Community Contributions:** Open-source the project to encourage community testing and improvement.
